# Movie Tracker
The application ranks various movies out of 5 stars, where the user can move each movie from **highest** to **lowest** ranking. 
Rankings can be saved for further use, or loaded from a pre-existing file. Adding and removing a movie can be done simply by pressing the
corresponding buttons, which updates the rankings.

Those who are **casual** and **hardcore** movie fans can use it, as it can track what movies they have watched and their own ratings for each movie, 
which can be beneficial if they want to share their opinions to others, or even to keep a personal tracking of what they have seen. 
This project interests me because I watch a lot of movies, but I do not personally track what I have watched. 
As a result, this project will help me be able to keep note of what movies I like or disliked, as well as how a certain movie I have watched ranks with others.
