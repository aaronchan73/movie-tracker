# Movie Tracker
The application will rank various movies out of 5 stars, and put each movie in chronological order from **highest** to 
**lowest** ranking. Those who are **casual** and **hardcore** movie fans will use it, as it can track what movies they 
have watched and their own ratings for each movie, which can be beneficial if they want to share their opinions to 
others, or even to keep a personal tracking of what they have seen. This project interests me because I watch a lot of 
movies, but I do not personally track what I have watched. As a result, this project will help me be able to keep note 
of what movies I like or disliked, as well as how a certain movie I have watched ranks with other movies.
